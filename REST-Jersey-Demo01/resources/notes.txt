------------------------
Using the tutorial on the following site: 
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/REST/article.html
ca.cogomov.jersey.first

TODO 
 - rewrite the client to be Jersey 2.0
 - could not get all functionality of client to work. 
 
can test with >curl localhost:8080/rest/hello

curl --header "Accept: text/plain" localhost:8080/REST-Jersey-Demo01/rest/todo-second/count
 
 ----------------------------
 Java Web Services Up and Running
 ca.cogomov.jersey.second - taken from this book. 
  - not fully functional - no client examples.
  - client examples in this book are all Jersey 1. Don't bother. 
  - using client examples from first resource(vogella) to access ca.cogomov.jersey.second resources
 
can test with >curl localhost:8080/rest2/json

Pluralsite course: 
com.pluralsite.*

http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/restful-services-java-using-jersey

curl  localhost:8080/REST-Jersey-Demo01/pluralsite/activities

Difficult to find json jars without maven. see: 
https://java.net/jira/browse/GLASSFISH-21141
Still can't get JSON to work. Need to find the appropriate jar files. Maven does it all for you!!!
Now works:
Discovered method of getting jars. Download and build the application as per maven examples. Explode the war file and get the jars
from WEB-INF/lib 

curl  localhost:8080/REST-Jersey-Demo01/pluralsite/activities/xxxx

curl  localhost:8080/REST-Jersey-Demo01/pluralsite/activities/xxxx/user
curl -i --header "Accept application/xml" localhost:8080/REST-Jersey-Demo01/pluralsite/activities

Using Chrome plugin 'Poster' to test functionality. 

Post Client Demo module - did not get POST to work with JSON. Problem with JSON handling. 
Error Message: 
org.glassfish.jersey.message.internal.MessageBodyProviderNotFoundException: MessageBodyWriter not found for media type=application/json, 
type=class com.pluralsite.model.Activity, genericType=class com.pluralsite.model.Activity.

Post from Poster and from client works when changed to XML. Something wrong with passing JSON for POST. 

== Next module - PUT



Dependency issue: 
jersey-container-servlet-core-2.2.jar and jersey-container-servlet.jar cannot co-exist. 
Removed jersey-container-servlet.jar
