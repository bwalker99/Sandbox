
FoM Building Block Template


Features: 
- Uses a simplified MVC model: jsp -> servlet call -> jsp 
- very little java code in jsp. 
- shows how to call and process a form, and return data to a jsp view page. 
- example calls to APIs to get user and course information. 
- uses the slf4j logging mechanism


TODO: 
Display Pages
- A couple of different types of web pages can be created based on BB taglibs.
- This example uses:	<bbNG:learningSystemPage ctxId="ctx">
- To be explored, the simpler: <bbNG:includedPage ctxId="ctx" >

bb-manifest.xml
 - This is a very important file. Defines where a module can be deployed.
 - more than one module can be defined and deployed for one Building Block war project. 
 - this example uses an organization module, which can be deployed on a 'portal' page. Probably a course module page also. 
 - Other types of modules are: course tools, other tools, admin modules. 
 - permissions area is very important. Defines what resources and APIs the Building Block is allowed to access.
